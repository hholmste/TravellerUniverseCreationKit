TravellerUniverseCreationKit
============================

This is a fairly simple implementation of the system- and subsector generation rules presented in Mongoose's Traveller core rulebook. It primarily presents JSON-objects for third-parties to consume, but also provides an incredibly rudimentary HTML-page. 

This should hopefully be your one-stop shop for systems and subsectors.

It is implemented as a node.js application, so in order to use it for anything, you'll have to run node somewhere.

Usage: node server.js
